## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **development**: Active development branch
- **feature/***: Feature branches
- **bugfix/***: Bug fix branches

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a feature branch from `development`
4. Make your changes
5. Write/update tests
6. Ensure all tests pass
7. Submit a pull request to `development`

### Code Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Include directory name in file header comments
- Add validators and loggers to all modules
- Write comprehensive tests
- Update documentation as needed

### Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation if needed
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Update CHANGELOG.md if applicable
4. Request review from maintainers

## Architecture Principles

- Modular design
- First principle analysis
- Mathematical foundation
- Self-evolution support
- Comprehensive validation and logging
