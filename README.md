A cutting-edge neurosymbotic rule-based modular AI system designed to break through the barriers of reality using modern AI architecture. This project aims to solve the hardest problems in physics by building an integrated map of physics that can self-code and evolve.

## Vision

This project creates an AI system that:
- Uses modern AI structure and architecture
- Implements neurosymbotic principles (neural + symbolic reasoning)
- Operates as a rule-based modular system
- Self-codes and evolves continuously
- Integrates physics knowledge to uncover the unknown
- Maintains efficiency through proper architecture

## Architecture

The system is built on modular principles:
- **Core Engine**: Central neurosymbotic reasoning engine
- **Rule System**: Dynamic rule-based knowledge representation
- **Evolution Module**: Self-coding and self-improvement capabilities
- **Physics Integration**: Domain-specific physics knowledge modules
- **Validation & Logging**: Comprehensive validation and logging for AI transition
