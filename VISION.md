## The Mission

**Physics AI is building a self-evolving artificial intelligence to explore, unify, and expand humanity's understanding of physics.**

We're not building an AI that merely *uses* physics. We're building an AI that **thinks** like a physicist—one that can reason symbolically, discover patterns, propose hypotheses, and evolve its own capabilities in pursuit of deeper understanding.

## The Problem

Physics has a unification problem. For a century, we've had two incompatible frameworks describing reality:

| Framework | Describes | Limitation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Quantum Mechanics** | The very small | Breaks down at large scales |
| **General Relativity** | The very large | Breaks down at small scales |

Despite the efforts of brilliant minds—Einstein, Hawking, Witten—we haven't reconciled them. String theory remains unverified. Loop quantum gravity is incomplete. The Standard Model has 19 free parameters we can't derive from first principles.

**Why hasn't AI helped?**

Current AI systems are either:
- **Neural-only**: Great at patterns, terrible at symbolic reasoning (can't derive equations)
- **Symbolic-only**: Rigid, can't generalize or discover novel patterns
- **Static**: They don't improve themselves based on physics constraints

We need something different.

## Our Approach: Neurosymbolic Self-Evolution

Physics AI combines three capabilities no existing system has together:

### 1. 🧠 Neurosymbolic Reasoning

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   Hybrid Intelligence                    │
├────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┤
│     Neural Component   │     Symbolic Component         │
├────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┤
│ Pattern recognition    │ Logical inference              │
│ Similarity matching    │ Equation manipulation          │
│ Embedding-based search │ Conservation law checking      │
│ Learns from examples   │ Derives from first principles  │
├────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┤
│          Confidence-Weighted Integration                 │
│  "What the data suggests" + "What the math requires"    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. 🔬 Unified Physics Knowledge

We encode physics not as isolated equations, but as an **integrated knowledge graph**:

- **Classical Mechanics** → Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, Conservation Laws
- **Quantum Mechanics** → Schrödinger, Path Integrals, Uncertainty
- **Field Theory** → Maxwell, Yang-Mills, General Relativity
- **Statistical Mechanics** → Entropy, Phase Transitions

Each domain is connected by **symmetries**, **correspondences**, and **limiting cases**. The AI can traverse this graph to find unexpected connections.

### 3. 🧬 Self-Evolution

The system can analyze, critique, and improve its own code:

```python
# The AI examines its own performance
analysis = self_evolution.analyze_component("reasoning_engine")

# Proposes improvements based on physics constraints
improvement = self_evolution.propose_modification(
    target="inference_speed",
    constraint="must_preserve_conservation_laws"
)

# Validates before applying
if validator.verify_safety(improvement):
    self_evolution.apply(improvement)
```

This isn't AGI. It's **narrow self-improvement** constrained to physics-relevant capabilities, with human oversight at every step.

## The Hard Problems We're Targeting

### Phase 1: Foundational Unification
- Encode all major physics frameworks in a unified representation
- Build reasoning pathways between frameworks
- Identify known correspondences (classical limits, etc.)

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis
- Find logical gaps in current theories
- Identify where different frameworks make incompatible predictions
- Catalog assumptions that lack experimental support

### Phase 3: Synthesis
- Propose modifications that resolve inconsistencies
- Generate predictions that could distinguish between theories
- Collaborate with human physicists on refinements

### Phase 4: Discovery
- Explore the mathematical landscape for overlooked structures
- Find patterns that connect seemingly unrelated phenomena
- Suggest experiments that could test novel predictions

## Principles

### 1. Physics First
Every capability is grounded in physical constraints. The AI doesn't just generate text—it generates equations that satisfy conservation laws, dimensional analysis, and known limits.

### 2. Transparent Reasoning
No black boxes. Every conclusion has a chain-of-thought explanation that physicists can verify and critique.

### 3. Human-AI Collaboration
Physics AI is a **tool for physicists**, not a replacement. The best discoveries will come from humans and AI working together, each contributing what they do best.

### 4. Safe Evolution
Self-modification is powerful but dangerous. Every change is:
- Validated against physics constraints
- Tested before deployment
- Reversible if problems emerge

### 5. Open Science
This is an MIT-licensed open-source project. The future of physics shouldn't be locked in a corporate lab.

## Why This Matters

Physics isn't just an academic pursuit. Understanding the fundamental laws of nature has given us:
- **Electronics** (quantum mechanics)
- **GPS** (general relativity corrections)
- **Nuclear energy** (E=mc²)
- **MRI machines** (quantum spin)

The next breakthrough—whether it's quantum gravity, dark matter, or something we haven't imagined—could transform civilization.

**We're building the AI to help find it.**
