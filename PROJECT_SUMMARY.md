# Physics AI - Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project creates a **neurosymbotic rule-based modular AI system** designed to break through the barriers of reality using modern AI architecture. The system can self-code and evolve, integrating physics knowledge to solve the hardest problems.

## What Has Been Created

### 1. Core Architecture ✅

- **Core Engine** (`core/`): Central neurosymbotic reasoning engine that integrates neural and symbolic approaches
- **Rule System** (`rules/`): Dynamic rule-based knowledge representation with storage and evolution
- **Evolution Module** (`evolution/`): Self-coding and self-improvement capabilities
- **Physics Integration** (`physics/`): Domain-specific physics knowledge modules
- **Validators** (`validators/`): Comprehensive validation framework
- **Loggers** (`loggers/`): Logging system for tracking and future AI transition

### 2. Documentation ✅

- **README.md**: Project overview and getting started guide
- **MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md**: Complete architecture documentation
